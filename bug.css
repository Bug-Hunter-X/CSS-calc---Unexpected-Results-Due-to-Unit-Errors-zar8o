The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results due to unit mismatch or incorrect order of operations. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` is fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20)` will cause issues because `20` is missing a unit.  Another common issue is nested `calc()` functions that aren't properly parenthesized, leading to calculation errors.
